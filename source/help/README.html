    <h2>v0.7.2 - May 29 2011</h2>
      <p>Mainly internal code reorganization</p>

    <h2>v0.5.24 - Apr 19 2011</h2>
      <p>Changed PE Acquisition - call Acquisition_CloseAll at QXRD exit, fixed bug in
         setting lower bound exposure time</p>

    <h2>v0.5.23 - Apr 11 2011</h2>
      <p>Documentation upgrade. Added release notes to embedded documentation</p>

      <p>Changed PE acquisition - added lower bound to exposure times based on values returned by
      Acquire_GetIntTimes call to XISL library</p>

      <p>Allow setting exposure time from fresh start options dialog</p>

    <h2>v0.5.22 - Apr 7 2011</h2>
      <p>Changes in PE acquisition initialization to support more PE detector types</p>

    <h2>v0.5.21 - Apr 6 2011</h2>
      <p>Pre-triggered acquisition should be working again.</p>

      <p>Changes to file browser window, including a refresh button.  File browser windows do not
      auto-update you must click the refresh button.</p>

      <p>Show/Hide Rng... buttons now work in masking dialog</p>

      <p>More info saved in acquired files - Qxrd and Qt version numbers - also more shown in info
      dialog</p>

    <h2>v0.5.20 - Apr 4 2011</h2>

      <p>fixed problems with image accumulation.</p>

      <p>an initial implementation of a file browser that is more responsive when there
      are many files in a directory.</p>

      <p>load and save preferences commands which transfer application preferences to/from
      files.</p>

    <h2>v0.5.19 - Mar 30 2011</h2>

      <p>allows setting some preferences before the application starts.  To activate this
      pass the command line argument '-fresh' when starting QXRD.  On windows there's an extra
      in the start menu to do this automatically.</p>

    <h2>v0.5.18 - Mar 25 2011</h2>

      <p>contains fixes for an acquisition problem caused by not resetting exposure counts</p>

    <h2>v0.5.17 - Mar 22 2011</h2>

      <p>contains fixes and changes to the 'synchronized acquisition' mode</p>

      <p>Added a 'bipolar triangle' waveform.  Added nidaq.getAnalogInput and nidaq.setAnalogOutput
      script commands.  Added display of syncronization waveform to UI</p>

    <h2>v0.5.16 - Mar 14 2011</h2>
      <p>mainly involves a major re-write of the acquisition code to support 'synchronized' acquisition.</p>

      <p>This involves taking 'groups' of images while varying an external programming voltage (using a
      supported National Instruments NI-DAQ card).  You specify the number of images in a group and
      then QXRD adds together multiple cycles of acquired images in phase with the output waveform.</p>

      <p>The acquisition code does not currently support the pre-trigger acquisition mode of earlier versions.
      I was hoping to remove this, but it seems that people are actually using it so I had better put it
      back in.  The functions and parameters are there, but they don't do anything at the moment.</p>
