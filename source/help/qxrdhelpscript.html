    <h1>QXRD Scripting Help</h1>
    <p>
      Communication between spec and qxrd uses a subset of the spec
      'server' protocol.  Use the 'remote_cmd' and 'remote_eval'
      commands from spec, with the remote <b>host</b> argument of the
      form <b>"remotehost:qxrd"</b> where <b>remotehost</b> is the
      host name or IP address of the machine on which qxrd is running.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also a 'simple' text-based socket interface to QXRD -
      this is controlled by the 'simple server' configuration options.
      Normally the simple server listens on port 1234.  You can send
      one-line script commands to this port and QXRD will send back a
      single line of text if the script command returns a value, and nothing
      if it does not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commands sent to qxrd are executed by the qt ECMAScript
      interpreter, which is described at <a
      href="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.6/ecmascript.html">http://doc.trolltech.com/4.6/ecmascript.html</a>.
      In addition to the commands provided in ECMAScript itself 'qxrd'
      contains a number of commands designed to access its specific
      functions.  You can also type script commands into the lower
      text panel of the 'Messages' tab of the qxrd application itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a simple example, you can evaluate simple arithmetic
      expressions:
    </p>
    <p>
      <samp>111.SPEC> print remote_eval("zaphod:qxrd","42/23")</samp>
    </p>
    <p>
      <samp>1.82608695652174</samp>
    </p>
