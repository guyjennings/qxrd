See also QXRD_Git_Log
***** v0.7.6 - Jun 22 2011 *****
Implement gain /flat field correction during acquisition
***** v0.7.5 - Jun 6 2011 *****
Improved responsiveness for file browser windows when displaying many files
***** v0.7.4 - Jun 6 2011 *****
Delayed initialization option for acquisition
***** v0.7.3 - Jun 6 2011 *****
Improved debugging messages.
***** v0.7.2 - May 29 2011 *****
Mainly internal code reorganization
***** v0.5.24 - Apr 19 2011 *****
Changed PE Acquisition - call Acquisition_CloseAll at QXRD exit, fixed bug in
setting lower bound exposure time
***** v0.5.23 - Apr 11 2011 *****
Documentation upgrade. Added release notes to embedded documentation
Changed PE acquisition - added lower bound to exposure times based on values
returned by Acquire_GetIntTimes call to XISL library
Allow setting exposure time from fresh start options dialog
***** v0.5.22 - Apr 7 2011 *****
Changes in PE acquisition initialization to support more PE detector types
***** v0.5.21 - Apr 6 2011 *****
Pre-triggered acquisition should be working again.
Changes to file browser window, including a refresh button. File browser
windows do not auto-update you must click the refresh button.
Show/Hide Rng... buttons now work in masking dialog
More info saved in acquired files - Qxrd and Qt version numbers - also more
shown in info dialog
***** v0.5.20 - Apr 4 2011 *****
fixed problems with image accumulation.
an initial implementation of a file browser that is more responsive when there
are many files in a directory.
load and save preferences commands which transfer application preferences to/
from files.
***** v0.5.19 - Mar 30 2011 *****
allows setting some preferences before the application starts. To activate this
pass the command line argument '-fresh' when starting QXRD. On windows there's
an extra in the start menu to do this automatically.
***** v0.5.18 - Mar 25 2011 *****
contains fixes for an acquisition problem caused by not resetting exposure
counts
***** v0.5.17 - Mar 22 2011 *****
contains fixes and changes to the 'synchronized acquisition' mode
Added a 'bipolar triangle' waveform. Added nidaq.getAnalogInput and
nidaq.setAnalogOutput script commands. Added display of syncronization waveform
to UI
***** v0.5.16 - Mar 14 2011 *****
mainly involves a major re-write of the acquisition code to support
'synchronized' acquisition.
This involves taking 'groups' of images while varying an external programming
voltage (using a supported National Instruments NI-DAQ card). You specify the
number of images in a group and then QXRD adds together multiple cycles of
acquired images in phase with the output waveform.
The acquisition code does not currently support the pre-trigger acquisition
mode of earlier versions. I was hoping to remove this, but it seems that people
are actually using it so I had better put it back in. The functions and
parameters are there, but they don't do anything at the moment.
